# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The kvapp-c project exists to create a distributed key-value store that demonstrates the Raft consensus algorithm in a practical, educational implementation. This serves multiple purposes:

1. **Educational Value**: Provides a concrete implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm for learning distributed systems concepts
2. **Reference Implementation**: Serves as a well-documented, testable example of Raft in Rust
3. **Foundation for Distributed Systems**: Creates a solid base that could be extended for production use cases

## Problems It Solves

### Core Problem: Distributed Consensus
- **Challenge**: Multiple nodes in a distributed system need to agree on a consistent state
- **Solution**: Implements Raft consensus algorithm to ensure all nodes maintain identical logs and state

### Secondary Problems:
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures all nodes have the same key-value data
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating even when some nodes fail
- **Leader Election**: Automatically selects a leader when the current leader fails
- **Log Replication**: Safely replicates operations across all nodes

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

**For Developers/Students:**
- Clear, readable code that demonstrates Raft concepts
- Comprehensive test suite showing how each component works
- Well-documented interfaces that explain design decisions
- Easy to run and experiment with locally

**For System Operation:**
- Simple key-value operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Automatic leader election and failover
- Consistent reads and writes across the cluster
- Observable behavior for debugging and learning

### Key Behaviors

1. **Client Interactions**:
   - Clients send key-value operations to any node
   - Operations are forwarded to the leader if necessary
   - Clients receive consistent responses

2. **Consensus Process**:
   - Leader receives client requests
   - Leader replicates entries to followers
   - Leader commits entries once majority acknowledges
   - All nodes apply committed entries to their state machines

3. **Failure Handling**:
   - Automatic leader election when leader fails
   - Network partitions handled gracefully
   - System remains available with majority of nodes
