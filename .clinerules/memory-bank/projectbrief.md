# Project Brief: kvapp-c

## Project Overview

The kvapp-c project is a distributed key-value store built on the Raft consensus algorithm, implemented in Rust Edition 2024. This project serves as both a reference implementation of Raft and a foundation for understanding distributed systems concepts.

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Create a Key-Value Application**: Build a distributed key-value store that demonstrates practical distributed systems concepts
2. **Implement Raft Consensus Algorithm**: Complete implementation of the Raft consensus protocol as described in the original paper
3. **Ensure Full Testability**: Design the system to be comprehensively testable with both unit and integration tests
4. **Enable Debuggability**: Create a system that is easy to debug and understand using standard development tools

### Educational Goals
- Provide a clear, readable implementation of Raft consensus
- Demonstrate distributed systems patterns and best practices
- Create a codebase that serves as a learning resource for distributed systems concepts
- Show how to build testable, maintainable distributed systems

## Technical Foundation

### Language and Platform
- **Language**: Rust Edition 2024
- **Platform**: Windows 10 primary development environment
- **IDE**: VSCode with Rust Analyzer extension
- **Version Control**: Git

### Core Technical Decisions

#### Synchronous Design
- **No Async Runtime**: Deliberate choice to avoid async/await complexity
- **Thread-Based Concurrency**: Use std::thread and channels for concurrent processing
- **Simpler Debugging**: Standard debugging tools work effectively
- **Deterministic Testing**: Easier to write reproducible tests

#### Minimal Dependencies
- **Standard Library Focus**: Prefer std library implementations when possible
- **External Dependencies**: Only tempfile for testing, avoiding heavy frameworks
- **Dependency Strategy**: Add dependencies only when absolutely necessary

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events via MessageBus
- **Dependency Injection**: Trait-based interfaces enable comprehensive mocking and testing
- **Well-Defined Interfaces**: Clear separation of concerns with trait boundaries
- **State Machine Pattern**: Clear state transitions for Raft node states

## Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation

### Reference Materials
- **Original Paper**: https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf
- **Additional Resources**: https://raft.github.io

### Implementation Scope
The project implements the complete Raft consensus algorithm including:

1. **Leader Election**
   - Randomized election timeouts
   - Vote request and response handling
   - Majority-based leader selection
   - Split vote handling

2. **Log Replication**
   - AppendEntries RPC implementation
   - Log consistency checking and conflict resolution
   - Commit index advancement with majority consensus
   - Heartbeat mechanism for leader maintenance

3. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Election Safety (at most one leader per term)
   - Leader Append-Only Property (leaders never overwrite entries)
   - Log Matching Property (identical logs at same indices)
   - Leader Completeness Guarantee (leaders have all committed entries)

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Multi-node cluster simulation
   - Network partition and failure recovery testing
   - Data consistency verification across distributed scenarios

## System Architecture

### Component Structure
```
kvapp-c/
├── Storage Layer      # Persistence abstractions (Log, State, KV storage)
├── Network Layer      # Communication and event handling
├── Raft Layer         # Consensus algorithm implementation
├── KV Layer          # Key-value store operations
└── Testing Layer     # Comprehensive test infrastructure
```

### Key Design Patterns

#### Event-Driven Communication
- **MessageBus**: Central event routing system
- **Event Types**: RaftEvent, ClientEvent, NetworkEvent, TimerEvent
- **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through events, not direct calls

#### Trait-Based Dependency Injection
- **Storage Traits**: LogStorage, StateStorage, KVStorage
- **Network Traits**: NetworkTransport, EventBus
- **Application Traits**: StateMachine, KVStore
- **Mock Implementations**: Complete test doubles for all traits

#### Repository Pattern
- **Multiple Backends**: File-based and in-memory implementations
- **Consistent Interface**: Same trait interface for all storage types
- **Testing Support**: Easy switching between implementations for testing

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written alongside implementation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both unit and integration testing
- **Mock Everything**: All dependencies mocked for unit tests
- **Integration Scenarios**: Multi-node distributed testing

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit Tests**: 81 comprehensive unit tests covering all components
- **Integration Tests**: 10 integration tests for distributed scenarios
- **Mock Framework**: Complete mock implementations for all external dependencies
- **TestCluster**: Multi-node simulation framework for integration testing

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 91 out of 91 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- **Code Quality**: Clean compilation with comprehensive documentation
- **Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with trait-based design
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured, readable code with inline documentation
