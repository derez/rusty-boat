### Phase 2: Consensus Implementation (Not Started)
- [ ] **Raft State Machine**
  - Implement RaftNode with state management
  - Leader election algorithm
  - Log replication mechanism
  - Safety mechanisms and consistency checks

- [ ] **Network Communication**

  - Network partition scenarios
  - Leader election testing

### Phase 3: Key-Value Layer (Not Started)

  - Client interface for GET, PUT, DELETE operations
  - Command processing and response handling

- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
  - Client-server interaction testing
  - Data consistency verification
  - Performance benchmarking

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Not Started)

## Current Status

### Project State
- **Phase**: Design and Documentation Complete
- **Next Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure
- **Readiness**: Ready to begin implementation
- **Blockers**: None - all prerequisites completed

### Implementation Readiness
- **Architecture**: ✅ Fully designed and documented
- **Interfaces**: ✅ All major traits defined
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Comprehensive approach planned
- **Development Environment**: ✅ Rust project configured
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete memory bank initialized

### Key Metrics
- **Design Completion**: 100%
- **Implementation Completion**: 0%
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 0%
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% (design phase)

## Known Issues

### Current Issues
- None - project is in initial design phase

### Anticipated Challenges
- **Timing Complexity**: Raft algorithm requires careful timeout management
- **Network Simulation**: Testing distributed scenarios deterministically
- **State Consistency**: Ensuring all nodes maintain identical state
- **Error Recovery**: Handling various failure scenarios gracefully

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Current)
- **Synchronous Design**: Chosen for educational clarity and easier debugging
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard library preference for learning purposes
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Selected for loose coupling and testability
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enables comprehensive mocking and testing

### Future Decision Points
- **Serialization Format**: Will need to choose between manual implementation or serde
- **Logging Strategy**: May add structured logging as project grows
- **Performance Optimizations**: Will evaluate after basic implementation
- **Testing Framework**: May add property-based testing with proptest

## Next Session Preparation

### Ready to Start
- **Phase 1 Implementation**: All design work completed
- **Clear Roadmap**: Step-by-step implementation plan defined
- **Testing Strategy**: Mock-first approach with trait-based interfaces
- **Documentation**: Complete memory bank for context continuity

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [ ] Basic module structure created
- [ ] Core types and traits defined
- [ ] Storage abstractions implemented
- [ ] Event system foundation working
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Mock implementations for testing

The project has a solid foundation and is ready to move from design to implementation. All architectural decisions are documented, and the memory bank provides complete context for future development sessions.
