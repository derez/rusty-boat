## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Confirmed Design Decisions
- **Synchronous Architecture**: Proved excellent for debugging and comprehensive testing
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enabled comprehensive mocking and testing
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Provided loose coupling and testability
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard library approach worked well
- **CLI-First Approach**: Excellent for demonstrating functionality

### Lessons Learned
- **Log Replication Complexity**: Successfully mastered with careful state management
- **Test-Driven Development**: Critical for catching edge cases in distributed consensus
- **Raft Safety Properties**: Must be enforced at every step to maintain correctness
- **Mock Testing**: Essential for testing distributed scenarios in isolation
- **CLI Development**: Interactive interface provides immediate feedback on functionality
- **Component Integration**: Dependency injection enables clean architecture

### Future Considerations
- **Performance**: May need optimization for larger clusters
- **Persistence**: Could benefit from more sophisticated storage formats
- **Networking**: TCP works well, but may need connection pooling
- **Testing**: Property-based testing could enhance coverage

The project has successfully completed Phase 4 (Network Communication) with a fully functional distributed key-value store with real TCP network communication. The implementation includes a complete Raft consensus algorithm, comprehensive CLI interface, file-based persistence, robust testing, and production-ready network communication. The system is now a complete distributed system ready for Phase 5: production features.
