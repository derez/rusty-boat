### Implementation Strategy for Phase 2
1. **Start with Leader Election**: Implement timeout-driven election process
2. **Add Log Replication**: Build on election to implement log consistency
3. **Integrate Safety Checks**: Ensure all Raft safety properties
4. **Build Integration Tests**: Multi-node scenarios with controlled networking
5. **Performance Testing**: Measure and optimize consensus performance

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Confirmed Design Decisions
- **Synchronous Architecture**: Proved excellent for debugging and testing
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enabled comprehensive mocking and testing
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Provided loose coupling and testability
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard library approach worked well

### Lessons Learned
- **Import Organization**: Need better organization to avoid circular dependencies
- **Test Structure**: Mock implementations should be in separate test modules
- **Serialization**: Simple hex/string encoding sufficient for educational goals
- **File Persistence**: Append-only logs work well with simple recovery

### Future Considerations
- **Performance**: May need optimization for larger clusters
- **Persistence**: Could benefit from more sophisticated storage formats
- **Networking**: TCP works well, but may need connection pooling
- **Testing**: Property-based testing could enhance coverage

The project has successfully completed Phase 1 with a robust, well-tested foundation ready for implementing the core Raft consensus algorithm. All architectural decisions have been validated through comprehensive testing, and the codebase is ready for the next phase of development.
