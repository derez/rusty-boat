## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Validated Architecture Decisions
- **Synchronous Design**: Proved excellent for debugging and comprehensive testing
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enabled complete dependency injection and mocking
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Provided perfect loose coupling between components
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard library approach worked exceptionally well

### Implementation Patterns Confirmed
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection with trait-based interfaces works perfectly
- **State Machine Pattern**: Clear state transitions working well for Raft node states
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes driven by events through MessageBus
- **Repository Pattern**: Storage abstractions with multiple implementations

### Testing Strategy Validated
- **Unit Tests**: Mock all dependencies using trait implementations - highly effective
- **Integration Tests**: File-based persistence with temporary directories works well
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 100% test pass rate demonstrates solid implementation

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization (Validated)
- **Module per Component**: Each major component in its own module - excellent separation
- **Trait Definitions in Implementation Files**: Solved circular dependency issues
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests alongside implementation proved very effective

### Error Handling (Working Well)
- **Result<T, Error> Pattern**: All fallible operations return Result - consistent
- **Custom Error Types**: Specific error types for different failure modes - clear debugging
- **No Panics**: Graceful error handling throughout - robust system

### Concurrency Model (Working in Phase 2)
- **Thread per Component**: Major components will run in separate threads
- **Message Passing**: Use channels for inter-thread communication
- **Minimal Shared State**: Prefer message passing over shared memory

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Phase 2 Key Learnings
- **Log Replication Complexity**: Successfully mastered with careful state management
- **Test-Driven Development**: Critical for catching edge cases in distributed consensus
- **Raft Safety Properties**: Successfully enforced at every step to maintain correctness
- **Mock Testing**: Essential for testing distributed scenarios in isolation

### Implementation Challenges Overcome
- **Match Index Logic**: Correctly implemented using follower's log index
- **Conflict Resolution**: Successfully implemented complex logic for detecting and resolving log conflicts
- **Commit Index Advancement**: Properly implemented majority calculation and term checking
- **Term Consistency**: Ensured leader terms match log entry terms for proper operation

### Design Trade-offs Validated
- **Simplicity over Performance**: Educational goals prioritized clarity - successful approach
- **Synchronous over Async**: Much easier debugging and reasoning - excellent choice
- **Comprehensive Testing**: High test coverage catching issues early
- **Incremental Implementation**: Step-by-step approach working excellently
