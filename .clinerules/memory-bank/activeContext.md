  - Requirement: Use exact server cluster addresses from command line
- **Port Conversion Logic Removed**: Eliminated automatic port conversion in both constructors
  - Updated `with_cluster_addresses()` to use addresses exactly as provided
  - Updated `with_config_and_addresses()` to use addresses exactly as provided
  - Simplified constructor logic by removing complex port parsing and conversion
- **Test Updates**: Modified all tests to expect original addresses
  - Updated `test_kv_client_creation()` to expect `127.0.0.1:8080` instead of `127.0.0.1:9080`
  - Updated `test_kv_client_with_config()` to expect original addresses
  - Renamed `test_kv_client_address_conversion()` to `test_kv_client_exact_addresses()`
  - All tests now verify addresses are used exactly as provided
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintained system stability and functionality
  - All 6 KV client tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Full test suite: 104/104 tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Clean compilation with only minor warnings (unused imports/variables)
  - No functional regressions in existing functionality
- **Result**: Client now connects to exact server addresses as specified in command line
  - Input: `--cluster 127.0.0.1:8080` → Client connects to `127.0.0.1:8080`
  - Eliminates confusion about port conversion
  - More predictable and intuitive behavior
  - Aligns with user expectations

  - New config constructor: `with_config_and_addresses(node_id, config, cluster_addresses)`
  - Removed old `new()` and `with_config()` methods that used fallbacks
- **Enhanced Request Processing**: Robust multi-server connection logic

- **Request-Response Pattern**: Simple request-response model for client operations
- **Leader-Only Processing**: Clients should communicate with Raft leader for write operations
- **Read Optimization**: Consider allowing reads from followers for better performance

### Implementation Strategy Validated
- **Incremental Approach**: Step-by-step fixes proved effective for complex distributed system
- **Stub Replacement**: Systematic replacement of stub implementations with real functionality
- **Compilation-First**: Ensuring clean compilation before functional testing
- **Architecture Preservation**: Maintaining existing distributed system architecture while fixing issues

### Technical Decisions Confirmed
- **Synchronous Design**: Continues to work well for debugging and development
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enabled clean separation and testing of components
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Server event loop structure supports client request processing
- **File-Based Persistence**: Storage layer ready for data persistence once requests flow through

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Issue Resolution Methodology (Successful)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation of client operations and data flow
- **Component-by-Component Review**: Examined each layer (client, server, storage) individually
- **Compilation-Driven Development**: Fixed compilation errors before functional testing
- **Memory Bank Consultation**: Used project history to understand expected behavior

### Code Quality Standards (Maintained)
- **Clean Compilation**: All compilation errors resolved, only minor warnings remain
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved during fixes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintained logging infrastructure throughout changes
- **Test Coverage**: No regressions in existing test suite

### Architecture Validation (Confirmed)

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Distributed System Debugging
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracing data from client through server to storage reveals bottlenecks
- **Stub Identification**: Recognizing stub implementations is crucial for functionality issues
- **Component Integration**: Each layer must properly integrate with adjacent layers

### Client-Server Communication Patterns
- **Request Processing Pipeline**: Client → Network → Server → Raft → Storage → Response
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling at each layer prevents silent failures
- **Leader-Follower Dynamics**: Client requests must reach the current Raft leader
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring client sees consistent state across operations

### Development Process Validation
- **Memory Bank Usage**: Project documentation proved invaluable for understanding context
- **Incremental Fixes**: Step-by-step approach prevented introducing new issues
- **Compilation Feedback**: Rust compiler errors provided clear guidance for fixes
