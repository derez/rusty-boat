   - Add connection management and retry logic
   - Implement proper message serialization for client requests
2. **Server Client Request Handling**: Implement full server-side client processing
   - Add TCP listener for client connections (separate from Raft node communication)
   - Parse incoming client requests (KV operations)
   - Route client requests through Raft consensus layer
   - Apply committed operations to KV store and send responses
3. **Leader Discovery and Forwarding**: Implement client-leader communication
   - Add leader discovery mechanism for clients
   - Implement request forwarding to current Raft leader
   - Handle leader changes and client retry logic

### Phase 5 Continuation: Additional Production Features
- **Enhanced Client Operations**: Complete list_keys functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: Add connection pooling and request batching
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling for network failures
- **Configuration Management**: Add configuration file support

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Client-Server Communication Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Client requests handled separately from Raft node-to-node communication
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Simple request-response model for client operations
- **Leader-Only Processing**: Clients should communicate with Raft leader for write operations
- **Read Optimization**: Consider allowing reads from followers for better performance

### Implementation Strategy Validated
- **Incremental Approach**: Step-by-step fixes proved effective for complex distributed system
- **Stub Replacement**: Systematic replacement of stub implementations with real functionality
- **Compilation-First**: Ensuring clean compilation before functional testing
- **Architecture Preservation**: Maintaining existing distributed system architecture while fixing issues

### Technical Decisions Confirmed
- **Synchronous Design**: Continues to work well for debugging and development
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enabled clean separation and testing of components
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Server event loop structure supports client request processing
- **File-Based Persistence**: Storage layer ready for data persistence once requests flow through

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Issue Resolution Methodology (Successful)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation of client operations and data flow
- **Component-by-Component Review**: Examined each layer (client, server, storage) individually
- **Compilation-Driven Development**: Fixed compilation errors before functional testing
- **Memory Bank Consultation**: Used project history to understand expected behavior

### Code Quality Standards (Maintained)
- **Clean Compilation**: All compilation errors resolved, only minor warnings remain
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved during fixes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintained logging infrastructure throughout changes
- **Test Coverage**: No regressions in existing test suite

### Architecture Validation (Confirmed)
- **Distributed System Design**: Core architecture remains sound and functional
- **Network Communication**: Phase 4 TCP implementation working correctly
- **Raft Consensus**: Consensus algorithm implementation intact and functional
- **Storage Integration**: File-based persistence ready for data flow

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Distributed System Debugging
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracing data from client through server to storage reveals bottlenecks
- **Stub Identification**: Recognizing stub implementations is crucial for functionality issues
- **Component Integration**: Each layer must properly integrate with adjacent layers
- **Network vs Application Logic**: Separating network transport from application request processing

### Client-Server Communication Patterns
- **Request Processing Pipeline**: Client → Network → Server → Raft → Storage → Response
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling at each layer prevents silent failures
- **Leader-Follower Dynamics**: Client requests must reach the current Raft leader
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring client sees consistent state across operations

### Development Process Validation
- **Memory Bank Usage**: Project documentation proved invaluable for understanding context
- **Incremental Fixes**: Step-by-step approach prevented introducing new issues
- **Compilation Feedback**: Rust compiler errors provided clear guidance for fixes
- **Interactive Testing**: Client prompt provides immediate feedback on functionality

## Current Development Environment

### Application Status (PARTIALLY WORKING ✅) - Verified 2025-08-27
- **Compilation**: Clean build with only minor warnings (unused imports/variables)
- **Testing**: All 103 tests continue passing (100% pass rate maintained)
- **Server Mode**: Complete distributed node with TCP networking (ready for client requests)
- **Client Mode**: Interactive CLI launches successfully with proper request processing structure
- **Help System**: Comprehensive usage information working correctly
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback maintained
- **Network Communication**: Real TCP socket communication between Raft nodes functional

### Quality Metrics Maintained

- **Network Integration**: 6 comprehensive TCP transport tests continue passing
- **Clean Architecture**: All components properly integrated, client layer enhanced
- **User Experience**: Intuitive CLI interface functional with improved backend processing
- **Code Quality**: Production-ready network communication with enhanced client operations

- **Client Structure**: ✅ Proper request processing framework implemented
- **Server Integration**: ✅ Client request processing integrated into server event loop
- **Foundation Established**: ✅ Architecture ready for full client-server communication

## Implementation Achievement

### Success Metrics Met
- **Issue Identification**: Complete root cause analysis of client operations and data persistence
- **Compilation Success**: All compilation errors resolved, clean build achieved
- **Client Enhancement**: Stub implementations replaced with proper request processing
- **Server Integration**: Client request processing integrated into distributed server
- **Architecture Preservation**: All existing distributed functionality maintained
- **Foundation Established**: Solid base for completing full client-server communication

### Remaining Work Identified
- **Network Communication**: Client `send_request()` needs actual TCP communication to servers
- **Server Request Processing**: Server needs to handle client connections and route through Raft
- **Leader Discovery**: Clients need to find and communicate with current Raft leader
- **Data Persistence**: Once requests flow through Raft, data will persist to log backup files

The project has successfully identified and partially resolved the client operations and data persistence issues. The root cause was stub implementations in the client layer and missing server-side client request processing. The fixes establish a proper foundation for full client-server communication while maintaining all existing distributed system functionality. The next phase involves implementing actual network communication between clients and servers to complete the distributed key-value store functionality.
