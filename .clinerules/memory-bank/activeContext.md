# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: KVClient Connection Issue Resolution - COMPLETED ✅

**Issue Resolved**: "Failed to connect to server at 127.0.0.1:9000: Serialization error: Unknown response type"

**Root Cause**: Client was receiving `RaftMessage::LeaderRedirect` (message type 6) from server when connecting to a non-leader node, but client's `deserialize_response()` method only handled `KVResponse` types (0-4).

**Solution Implemented**: Enhanced KVClient to handle `RaftMessage::LeaderRedirect` responses by:
1. Adding case 6 to `deserialize_response()` method to handle LeaderRedirect messages
2. Adding `parse_leader_redirect()` method to properly parse LeaderRedirect message format
3. Converting LeaderRedirect messages to user-friendly error messages that inform clients about leader redirection

**Previous Phase**: Phase 6 - Client Command Raft Log Integration (FULLY COMPLETED)
- **Status**: System now fully Raft-compliant with all client commands going through consensus algorithm
- **Achievement**: Complete distributed key-value store with Raft-compliant client command processing, async response handling infrastructure, AND comprehensive multi-node consistency testing
- **Current Step**: Phase 6 Step 3 completed (Multi-Node Consistency Testing). Ready for Phase 6 Step 4: Documentation and Validation.
