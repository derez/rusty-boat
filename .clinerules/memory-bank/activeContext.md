- **KV Client Implementation Fixes**: Enhanced client operations in `src/kv/client.rs`
  - Replaced stub implementations in `get()`, `put()`, and `delete()` methods
  - Added `send_request()` method for proper request processing
  - Implemented proper error handling and response type validation
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing interfaces
- **Server-Side Processing**: Added client request processing infrastructure in `src/main.rs`
  - Implemented `process_client_requests()` function in server event loop
  - Integrated client request processing with main server loop
  - Fixed compilation errors related to missing RaftNode methods
  - Established foundation for full client-server communication

### Dynamic Cluster Addressing Implementation (COMPLETED ✅) - Session 2025-08-27
- **Removed Hardcoded Fallbacks**: Eliminated all default IP address fallbacks as requested

  - Client now fails gracefully when no cluster addresses provided
  - Clear error message: "No cluster addresses configured"
- **Enhanced Client Architecture**: Complete restructure of KVClient for dynamic addressing
  - Added `cluster_addresses` field to store dynamic server addresses
  - New primary constructor: `with_cluster_addresses(node_id, cluster_addresses)`
  - New config constructor: `with_config_and_addresses(node_id, config, cluster_addresses)`
  - Removed old `new()` and `with_config()` methods that used fallbacks
- **Automatic Address Conversion**: Smart address resolution for client-server communication
  - Converts server addresses to client ports (adds 1000 to port number)
  - Example: `127.0.0.1:8080` → `127.0.0.1:9080`
  - Handles various address formats (localhost, IP addresses, different ports)
- **Enhanced Request Processing**: Robust multi-server connection logic
  - `send_request()` tries each cluster address sequentially
  - `try_server_request()` handles individual server connection attempts
  - Proper error propagation and retry logic
  - Comprehensive logging showing connection attempts and results
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Updated all tests for new architecture
  - 6/6 client tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Tests for address conversion, error handling, and configuration
  - Verified backward compatibility where appropriate
- **Live Verification**: Confirmed working client-server communication
  - Client uses CLI cluster addresses: `--cluster 127.0.0.1:8080`
  - Successful TCP communication with server
  - LIST command returned existing keys: "444", "dat2"
  - Proper verbose logging showing connection flow

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Client-Server Communication Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Client requests handled separately from Raft node-to-node communication
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Simple request-response model for client operations
- **Leader-Only Processing**: Clients should communicate with Raft leader for write operations
- **Read Optimization**: Consider allowing reads from followers for better performance

### Implementation Strategy Validated
- **Incremental Approach**: Step-by-step fixes proved effective for complex distributed system
- **Stub Replacement**: Systematic replacement of stub implementations with real functionality
- **Compilation-First**: Ensuring clean compilation before functional testing
- **Architecture Preservation**: Maintaining existing distributed system architecture while fixing issues

### Technical Decisions Confirmed
- **Synchronous Design**: Continues to work well for debugging and development
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: Enabled clean separation and testing of components
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Server event loop structure supports client request processing
- **File-Based Persistence**: Storage layer ready for data persistence once requests flow through

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Issue Resolution Methodology (Successful)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation of client operations and data flow
- **Component-by-Component Review**: Examined each layer (client, server, storage) individually
- **Compilation-Driven Development**: Fixed compilation errors before functional testing
- **Memory Bank Consultation**: Used project history to understand expected behavior

### Code Quality Standards (Maintained)
- **Clean Compilation**: All compilation errors resolved, only minor warnings remain
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved during fixes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintained logging infrastructure throughout changes
- **Test Coverage**: No regressions in existing test suite

### Architecture Validation (Confirmed)
- **Distributed System Design**: Core architecture remains sound and functional
- **Network Communication**: Phase 4 TCP implementation working correctly
- **Raft Consensus**: Consensus algorithm implementation intact and functional
- **Storage Integration**: File-based persistence ready for data flow

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Distributed System Debugging
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracing data from client through server to storage reveals bottlenecks
- **Stub Identification**: Recognizing stub implementations is crucial for functionality issues
- **Component Integration**: Each layer must properly integrate with adjacent layers
- **Network vs Application Logic**: Separating network transport from application request processing

### Client-Server Communication Patterns
- **Request Processing Pipeline**: Client → Network → Server → Raft → Storage → Response
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling at each layer prevents silent failures
- **Leader-Follower Dynamics**: Client requests must reach the current Raft leader
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring client sees consistent state across operations

### Development Process Validation
- **Memory Bank Usage**: Project documentation proved invaluable for understanding context
- **Incremental Fixes**: Step-by-step approach prevented introducing new issues
- **Compilation Feedback**: Rust compiler errors provided clear guidance for fixes
- **Interactive Testing**: Client prompt provides immediate feedback on functionality
