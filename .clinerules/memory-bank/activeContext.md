- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard library approach worked exceptionally well

### Implementation Patterns Confirmed
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection with trait-based interfaces works perfectly
- **State Machine Pattern**: Clear state transitions working well for Raft node states
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes driven by events through MessageBus

- **Custom Error Types**: Specific error types for different failure modes - clear debugging
- **No Panics**: Graceful error handling throughout - robust system

### Concurrency Model (Working in Phase 2)
- **Thread per Component**: Major components will run in separate threads
